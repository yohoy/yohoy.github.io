# Nutri-Score
The Nutri-Score system was developped after Article 14 of the Modernisation Law for the health system, dated 26 January 2016, required the french authorities to recommend a front-of-pack system of labelling that would be simple and accessible for all.
The new system includes a colour coded scheme, ranging from green to orange, associated with letters from A to E. 
Products designated with an 'A' have the best nutritional quality, while products designated with an E have poorer nutritional quality.

## Points A

| Points | Energy (kJ) | Fat (g) | Sugar (g) | Sodium (mg) |
|:------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:---------:|:-----------:|
|    0   |    <=335    |   <=1   |   <=4.5   |     <=90    |
|    1   |     >335    |    >1   |    >4.5   |     >90     |

## Points C

| Points | Fruits Vegetables Nuts (%) | Fiber (g) | Proteins (g) |
|:------:|:--------------------------:|:---------:|:------------:|
|    0   |            <=40            |   <=0.9   |     <=1.6    |
|    1   |             >40            |    >0.9   |     >1.6     |
|    2   |             >60            |    >1.9   |     >3.2     |
|    3   |              -             |    >2.8   |     >4.8     |
|    4   |              -             |    >3.7   |     >6.4     |
|    5   |             >80            |    >4.7   |     >8.0     |

## Nutri-Score Computation
* If `points A` < 11, then `score` = `points A` - `points C`
* If `points A` >= 11:
	* If `points(Fruits/Vegetables/Nuts)` = 5, then `score` = `points(A)` - `points(C)`
	* If `points(Fruits/Vegetables/Nuts)` < 5, then `score` = `points(A)` - (`points(Fiber)` + `points(Fruits/Vegetables/Nuts)`)

## Letters Threshold
### Solid Food
  * A: until -1
  * B: from 0 to 2
  * C: from 3 to 10
  * D: from 11 to 18
  * E: 19 and more
  
### Beverages 
  * A: mineral and spring water
  * B: until 1
  * C: from 2 to 5
  * D: from 6 to 9
  * E: 10 and more

## Warning
When fiber content is not present, its eventual positive contribution is not taken into account.

Percentages corresponding to Fruits/Vegetables/Nuts are mainly missing from the packaging. 
It will be derived from other products as follows:
  * 100% : Fruit Juices
  * 90% : Fruit Compote
  * 85% : Vegetables
  * 50% : Jams
  
Tubers are not considered as vegetables for the nutri-score.
